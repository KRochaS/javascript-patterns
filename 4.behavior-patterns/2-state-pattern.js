// State Pattern

// has become very popular with React's usage.

// basically the state pattern is one where we hold 
// the state of the application with all the data 
// and properties needed  and when it changes it updates 
// a rendering of the application 
// and again needless to say, React, and Angular and 
// every state management library are great examples of its use.
