// The decorator pattern

// Is very similar to mixins, where we decorate code
// with classes or code that came from another area
// here is actual syntax in the most recent versions
// of Javascript and has been used for a while 
// in Typescript and is heavily used in Angular code.


// So the purpose of a decorator pattern. like a mixin
// is to take, for example, a class and extended it
// with other code
